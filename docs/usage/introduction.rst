Introduction
============

This is a proof-of-concept prototype application, intended to demonstrate the advantages of using database-backed software to assist with various workflows utilised by the DNSyR team.

The application will ultimately take the form of a web application, allowing the user to add, update, edit and delete data, however the design in the early stages is agnostic to the type of 'front-end' that is used.

Features
========

Designs about what features or capabilities to be pursued within the project should be taken following thorough consultation with the team and other stakeholders. The followingfeatures have been prioritised at an early stage:

* Engagement Planning
* Inspection Preparation
* Basic inspector scheduling
* "Year On A Page"

Possible features beyond these include:

* Full codification of JSPs, DSyAPs, DSTAIGs and other policy/reference documents
* Inspection/assessment data storage and analysis
* Stakeholder engagement tracking
* Application of ratings SOP to automate report production
